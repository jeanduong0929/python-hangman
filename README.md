# Hangman Game: A Python Console Application

## Objectives

Understand and implement the key functions in the Hangman game.
Gain practical experience in Python programming and handling text-based user interfaces.

## Prerequisites

- Python environment.
- Basic knowledge of Python programming.

## Setup Instructions

1. Ensure Python is installed on your system.
2. Clone the repository to your local machine.

## Game Overview

In this console-based Hangman game, you will interact with a simple text interface to guess words. The game selects a random word from a list, and your task is to guess the word one letter at a time. For each incorrect guess, a part of the hangman is drawn. The game ends when you guess the word correctly or when the hangman is fully drawn.

**What is Hangman?**

Hangman is a classic word game in which players guess a word or phrase one letter at a time. For each incorrect guess, a part of a hangman figure is drawn. The game ends when the word or phrase is guessed correctly or when the hangman figure is fully drawn.

**Relevance in This Project**

In this project, you will engage with Python programming to implement the Hangman game. The game's highlight is its simplicity and the fun it provides while also being a great way to learn and practice Python programming.
